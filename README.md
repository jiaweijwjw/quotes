# Quotes

This repository is a personal playground for implementing different tech stacks locally and putting them all together. It will be a mono repo whereby all the different components of the system will be within this repo.

> The application will just be a simple backend application which allows users to retrieve random quotes. The objective of this repo is to try out the setup of an entire system architecture from scratch locally.

### System architecture:

[Miro link to current architecture](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJ3mN9I=/?share_link_id=896675524915 "Miro Architecture")

## Current tech stack:

- **FastAPI** for backend application server
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Docker** for container management
- **Ubuntu server (headless) on RPI4** for physical hardware

## MVP for application logic

1. Able to fetch the quotes publicly
