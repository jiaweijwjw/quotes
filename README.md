# Quotes

This repository is a personal playground for implementing different tech stacks locally and putting them all together. It will be a mono repo whereby all the different components of the system will be within this repo.

> The application will just be a simple backend application which allows users to retrieve random quotes. The objective of this repo is to try out the setup of an entire system architecture from scratch locally.

To catchup on what is in the backlog to be implemented, refer to [todo-log.md](./todo-log.md).
To learn what has already been implemented, refer to the [documentation](./documentation/) directory.
### System architecture:

[Miro link to current architecture](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJ3mN9I=/?share_link_id=896675524915 "Miro Architecture")

## Current tech stack:

- **FastAPI** for backend application server
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Docker** for container management
- **Ubuntu server (headless) on RPI4** for physical hardware
- **NGINX** for reverse proxy and further security measures

## MVP for application logic

1. Able to fetch the quotes publicly
