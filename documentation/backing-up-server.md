# Backing up the Ubuntu server

Quick guide on backing up of the Ubuntu server in snapshots and also as a whole.

## Description
This linux server is meant to be a playground to try things out meaning that things go go wrong easily. However we do not want to be reinstalling the entire server from a fresh start everytime somethings goes wrong. It would be alot of work to set things up all over again. (The users, firewalls, configs and other settings).  

Hence we want to be able to save our linux server instance periodically, and it will be mainly done in 2 ways:
1. Saving the entire server as an image (used for important milestones when the server is running properly as expected).
2. Saving the server in a series of snapshots similar to Apple's time machine. (used for rolling back in times of fuck ups).
